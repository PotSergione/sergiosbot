containing the data used by PotBot: a CNNLSTM dynamic ensemble network to forecast bitcoin price. 

investment_data.csv = contains the current amount of euro invested
holding.csv = contains the current amount of euro not invested
previous_prices.csv = contains the previous bitocin prices rescaled via MInMax scaler to the date 2021-03-04

At the start of every hour the bot connects to Bitstamp and retrieves the current (closing) bitcoin/eur price and stores it to 
make a prediction using its ensemble CNN-LSTM. The prediction and the other variables are the fed to the bot itself which decides 
whether to withold the amount or keep the investment.
